I am a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Management Science and Engineering](https://msande.stanford.edu/) at the [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/). Before joining Stanford, I was a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Finance and Risk Engineering](https://engineering.nyu.edu/academics/departments/finance-and-risk-engineering) at the [New York University](https://www.nyu.edu/) from Sep 2024 - Sep 2025 and in the [Epstein Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering](https://ise.usc.edu/) at the [University of Southern California](https://usc.edu/) from Aug 2021 - Aug 2024. I am fortunate to be co-advised by Prof. [Renyuan Xu](https://renyuanxu.github.io/index.html) (Stanford) and Prof. [Meisam Razaviyayn](https://sites.usc.edu/razaviyayn/) (USC). I obtained my B.S. in Mathematics from [The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen](https://cuhk.edu.cn/), where I was advised by Prof. [Zizhuo Wang](https://mypage.cuhk.edu.cn/academics/wangzizhuo/). Please find my [CV](./files/CV_Yinbin_Han_11222025.pdf) here.
